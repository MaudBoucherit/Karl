## Introduction to Karl

`Karl` is a Linear Regression tool.

## Description:

This package will take a dataset with a continuous reponse variable and various continous explanatory variables, and provide the user with several functions to bulid a linear regression model. The fit of the regression can be tested using the diagnosis (residual) plots returned by the plotting function.
 
## Functions: 

#### Summary of Data: `EDA(X, y)`   
This function will return a table containing various statistics from the provided dataset. These statistics include the mean, variance, minimum, maximum and quantile (25, 50 and 75) values for continuous variables.

Arguments:

  - X: a dataframe containing continuous features
  - y: a numeric vector of same length containing the response

Values: a dataframe containing 

  - mean: the mean for response (y) and features (X)
  - variance: the variance for response (y) and features (X)
  - quantiles: the 25-50-75 quantiles for response (y) and features (X)
  - min: the minimum value for response (y) and features (X)
  - max: the maximum value for response (y) and features (X)
  
Usage: 

```
library(Karl)
# mock datasets for X and y
X <- data.frame('X1' = rnorm(10), 
                'X2' = rnorm(10),
                'X3' = rnorm(10))
y <- X$X1 + X$X2 + X$X3 + rnorm(10)
EDA(X,y)
```

#### Model Fit: `LinearRegression(X, y)` 

 This function returns a list object containing the weights, fitted values, and residuals from fitting a linear regression  of y on X.
 
Arguments:
 
   - X: a dataframe containing continuous features
   - y: a numeric vector of same length containing the response

Values: a list containing

  - weights: the estimates of the parameters of the linear regression
  - fitted: the fitted values
  - residuals: the residuals

Usage:

```
library(Karl)
X <- iris$Sepal.Length
y <â€“ iris$Sepal.Width
LinearRegression(X, y)
```

#### Residual Plot: `plot_karl((input: Model Object))` 

This function is used to plot the linear model object from the LinearRegression function. The linear model object is a list of lists that includes weights, fitted values, and residuals. This function will return 2 types of plots, which include:

  - Residuals vs Fitted Plot
  - Normal Q-Q Plot

Arguments:

  - lm object: a list of lists containing:
  	- weights: the estimates of the parameters of the linear regression
  	- fitted: the fitted values
  	- residuals: the residuals.

Value:

  - Residuals vs Fitted Plot
  - Normal Q-Q Plot
  
Usage:

```
library(Karl)
lm <- LinearRegression(X, y)
plot_karl(lm)
```
